# Kwan Theme 

This is a fork from [Elegant Theme](https://github.com/mudassir0909/jsonresume-theme-elegant) by Mudassir Ali, modified to improve print styles and in general simplify things. 

[Theme Preview](http://themes.jsonresume.org/kwan)

Other resumes may have the coin, but they won't have the 'Kwan'.

### To develop your resume

To develop iteratively (either to modify the template, CSS or resume contents) to the following

```
$ git clone https://github.com/mudassir0909/jsonresume-theme-elegant.git
$ cd jsonresume-theme-elegant
$ npm install
$ grunt watch // watches for less file changes
$ ./serve.js [optional_resume_filename] // Do this in a separate terminal to run the server with the provided resume or a default one
```
